This is the core source code behind WGBH Open Vault <http://openvault.wgbh.org>, a media catalog based on Blacklight, Solr, and Fedora. This core is not intended to be an out-of-the-box solution and may take additional work to deploy in other contexts. We would highly recommend looking at Blacklight <http://projectblacklight.org> or Hydra <https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/The+Hydra+Project> as a starting place for similar functionality, supported by a robust community.

A significant portion of the work and innovation that went into the making of WGBH Open Vault <http://openvault.wgbh.org> has been released as modular Blacklight plugins, simple demonstrators, or contributed back to core projects (such as Blacklight), making it easier for the community to build similar projects.
